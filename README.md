Recipe Generator
Basic Concept
Recipe Generator is like tinder for recipes. Don’t like what you see? Generate a new recipe with one click! Found something you like? Save it to your favorites and hit the grocery store!
Motivation for development? 
We couldn’t really decide on a specific api until someone in the group got hungry. At that point we all came together to decide channel our hunger into looking for an api that would provide us with the steps to cook a meal.
